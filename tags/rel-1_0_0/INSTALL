= Toolbawks Tags - Installation Directions

1. Create your Rails application, set up your databases.

2. Install the Toolbawks Tags (it will install Engines if it doesn't already exist)
	
	script/plugin install http://svn.toolbocks.com/plugins/toolbawks_tags/

3. Add the following within the "Rails::Initializer.run do |config|" block in config/environment.rb

    config.plugins = ["engines", "*"]

4. For good measure, you should update your JavaScripts to the latest version of Prototype and Scriptaculous.

  rake rails:update:javascripts

5. Add this line to any page that is to show the Tag Manager

	<%= javascript_include_tag 'core', :plugin => 'toolbawks_tags' %>
